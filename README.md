# URL Shortener

Build a scalable URL shortener service with APIs, persistence, and analytics.

## Development setup

Requires Python 3.11 or newer. Install the project and development dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the PostgreSQL and Redis connection
settings for your local services. The example values are for local development
only; do not use them as production credentials.

Start the API:

```powershell
uvicorn url_shortener.main:app --reload --app-dir src
```

`GET /health/live` reports whether the process is running and does not contact
external services. `GET /health/ready` checks PostgreSQL and Redis and returns
`503` if either dependency cannot be reached. The readiness response reports
dependency status without exposing connection details. The PostgreSQL readiness
probe has a configurable two-second deadline by default
(`URL_SHORTENER_DB_READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`).

Run the current tests with:

```powershell
pytest
```

Apply the PostgreSQL schema migration after configuring `.env`:

```powershell
alembic upgrade head
```

For a disposable development/test database, reverse the current migration with:

```powershell
alembic downgrade base
```

Database and Redis pool settings are per application process. Size them against
the database/server connection budgets multiplied by the number of deployed
processes; the example values are starting defaults, not load-tested capacity
recommendations.
